# Visions and Goals Planning

It is important to be open and honest with your mentor around these goals.  Admitting gaps can feel vulnerable at times, but it is most important in order to grow in these areas.

### Step 1: Brainstorm unthinkable goals

This should be something you want to do, but you canâ€™t imagine being able to accomplish

Choose one unthinkable goal from above to focus on and list it here:
*Note: From here on out you will work with this one goal, even though the sample provides multiple examples.

### Step 2: Name your blockers

What are things you may do that will hold yourself back from reaching your goal? List all potential blockers.

### Step 3:  Create a mantra
Create a phrase that encompasses your big goal:  It should be something you can do moment by moment. The idea is to integrate the spirit of the high level goal into moment by moment interactions and everyday situations.

### Step 4: Describe your starting point with respect to your goal.

List as much information as possible to help your mentor know where you are starting from.  Focus on facts first, craft the story later.

### Step 5: Write a vision

Write a comprehensive vision for yourself. This is written as if you are in the future. Include your environment and your emotions.

### Step 6: Define SMART goals

What are the SMART goals to get to that vision? (Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-sensitive)

### Step 7: Make a celebration strategy

 How will you celebrate each goal? (Be Specific - when will you celebrate?  How will you celebrate?s) It can be as big or small as you would like

### Step 8: Write down if-thens

What if-thens (aka Implementation Intentions) will you do (list at least 3)?  (These are triggers that will encourage new action)
