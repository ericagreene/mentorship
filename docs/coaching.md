## What is coaching?

Coaching is a process to discover and examine your assumptions, ways of thinking, expectations, beliefs, and reactions.

**Coaching is different that mentoring.**

| Mentoring   | Coaching  |
|---                                 | ---                    |
| goal is teaching skills or guiding | goal is self-reliance  |
| give answers                       | grow answers           |
| mentor is a expert                 | coach is a partner     |


## Why should you get a coach?

Coaching is a great way to grow your career. A coach can help you increase clarity and focus, hold yourself accountable for your commitments, build your leadership capabilities, increase your confidence and help you make BIG DECISIONS. In the business world, “You’re so broken you need a coach” has changed to “You’re so valuable you get a coach”.

Plus, many successful executives have coaches!

_"The coach doesn't have to play the sport as well as you do. They have to watch you and get you to be your best. In the business context a coach is not a repetitious coach. A coach is somebody who looks at something with another set of eyes, describes it to you in [his] words, and discusses how to approach the problem."_ ([link](http://archive.fortune.com/galleries/2009/fortune/0906/gallery.best_advice_i_ever_got2.fortune/14.html))

## How to be a coach

The key to being a coach is to ask **open-ended questions** and employ **actively listening** to challenge assumptions. When someone states a problem, instead of responding with a quick answer, try leading with a question.


Your questions should not be judgmental, avoid asking "why?".

* **Open evaluation:** Walk me through your thought process? What’s working? :thumbsup:
* **Closed evaluation:** Do you have a problem? Why do you keep doing things the same way if they're not working? :thumbsdown:

### 4 basic steps

**Step 1:** What's up? -- Figure out the context of the situation someone wants to talk about. _What would you like to talk about?_

**Step 2:** What Matters? -- Ask questions to understand what really matters to the person. _What do you really want?_

**Step 3:** What's Next? -- Probe into the changes or actions the person can do to help solve their problem. Ask open questions around next steps.
_What will you do?_ _What's next?_

**Step 4:** By When? -- Discuss commitment. How will the person how themselves accountable?
_When will you do it? What are you willing to commit to here?_

### Tips & Tricks
* See yourself as a thought partner, listen for potential
* Keep your questions open-ended
* Encourage self discovery
* Be willing to be surprised
* Put your attention on the person in front of you, not the issue
* Remove any obstacles, provide resources
* Maintain accountability
* Celebrate effort and results! :star:

_This is another mindset shift - you shift from listening for the situation, to listening for the person. So it’s common when you listen to someone talk about a problem to be thinking about whether we agree/disagree, whether it makes sense, how we can help, how to connect what they’re saying to what we already know, what we would do. You feel this need to ask for more and more information so that we can really understand their situation._

_The truth is we actually don’t need to know all about their situation - THEY know their situation. When you shift to listen for the person, you pay attention to what they reveal about their values, their motives, their needs… You can use open-ended questions to help them explore._

### Open Ended Questions
Below are examples of open-ended question you can use when coaching.

Explore options and generate solutions:

* What do you want?
* What are you building toward?
* What is the real reason you want that?
* What is beyond this problem?
* What do you hope to accomplish by doing that?
* What do you think some options are?
* What are your criteria for choosing?
* What do you think you should do?
* What’s the first step?
* What’s in your way?
* What would happen if you did nothing?
* What advice would you give to a friend about that?
* What’s your intuition telling you?
* What is the ideal?
* What would it look like?
* What decision would you make from a position of strength?

Probe for and achieve commitment:

* What do you need to put in place to accomplish this?
* What are you willing to commit to here?
* What are you responsible for here?
* What are you willing to give up?
* What is the worst that can happen?
* What are you avoiding?
* What made you react this way?  
* How is this way serving you?
* What one small step will you take now?
* When are you going to start?
* How will you know you have been successful?
* What do you need from me/others to help you achieve this?
* On a scale of one to ten, how committed/motivated are you to doing it?
* What would it take to make it a ten?

## Practice exercise  
In order to be a great coach, you need to practice! Here is a 25 minute exercise you can do with a partner to start working on your coaching skills.

**Peer Coaching (6 minutes)**

* Find a partner you don’t normally work with.
* Select which of you would be the coach.
* 1 minute for explaining what you would like to focus on or be coached on. It helps to pick a real problem, even if it's not a work problem.
* Start session (5 min)


**Reflection (6 minutes)**
* How did it go?
* Did you use yes/no questions?
* Did you challenge?
* Did you get a commitment?
* What did you learn? Impressions

Now, switch roles and try again!
